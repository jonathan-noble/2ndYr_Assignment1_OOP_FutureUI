# Assignment1_OOP
This assignment is loosely inspired by the film Doctor Strange. I aim to create a portal where a user can choose a place to teleport to. 
The portal itself should be very interactive and fun with the user on events: 
1. When mouse is clicked and moved, the user is given a chance to create a portal by drawing a portal-like shape
2. The portal should open only right after the correct pattern is drawn 
3. The user has options by pressing keys 1-5 to change the place to teleport to (CHECK)

It comes along with a user interface relative to the portal, such as: 
1. Number of place chosen pops out in a sequential order of the screen and eventually fades out
3. Battery status to implement remaining power left (using boolean) 
4. Rewind, slow down, fast forward the environment of the place  (CHECK)
5. Sound effects when portal opens, etc.

The background should use inheritance which should include:
1. Universe
2. A random grandfather clock
3. PShapes
4. Iconic people
5. BUNNY SUICIDE

The portal should include:
1. Rotate wildly clockwise - PVector encapsulated
2. Orangey particles spinning as it rotates
3. Possibility of letting the user choose where he could execute the portal by using translate(pmouseX, pmouseY)
4. Possibility of  changing the size of the portal by scrolling up or down

The places to teleport to:
a. Solar System - mainly Earth
b. YASC
c. Game Of Life
d. Funny Video 
e. World of Trump/ Stan Lee?   GIF || Someone's face popping out randomly
f. Peaceful aquarium with at least 3 fishes swimming around
g. "No rabbits were harmed"  in string and can be tickled
h. Pong game
i. Clock
