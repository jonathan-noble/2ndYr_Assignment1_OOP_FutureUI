___This assignment is loosely inspired by the recent Marvel film Doctor Strange. I made the User Interface as classic but still as complex as a futuristic marvel wizard. The user can summon a portal where a user is able to choose a place to teleport to.___ 

* The portal itself should be very interactive and fun with the user on events: 
1. When mouse is clicked and moved, the user is given a chance to create a portal by drawing a portal-like form
2. The user must draw the portal in accordance to the position of the nodes. Prepare to test your abilities wisely to summon a portal!
3. The portal should open only right after all the nodes are connected (HINT: ESPECIALLY ON THE MIDDLE NODE)
4. The user has options by pressing keys 1-5 to change the place to teleport to 

* It comes along with a user interface relative to the portal, such as: 
1. Number of main places relevant to the movie pops out once the user presses the numpads/1-5
  The main places (from the film) to teleport to:
  1. Solar System - Sun, Earth and it's Moon - where the Earth is orbiting around the Sun very slowly and the moon orbits around the Earth 
  2. New York 
  3. Paris (supposedly it's London but I realized I already have a grandfather clock and I don't want things to be mixed up)
  BONUS PLACE
  4. Game Of Life
2. Rewind(by dragging the mouse to the left), slow down, fast forward(by dragging the mouse to the right) the environment of the place especially on the Solar System
3. Sound effects when portal opens. e.g. "Bonjour" on Paris, etc.

* The background should use inheritance which includes Easter Eggs:
1. Universe - can also rewind, slow down and fast forward
2. A random grandfather clock
3. The DeLorean DMC 12 car from Back from the Future
4. BUNNY SUICIDE - Kindly search this iconic comedy cartoon. One will understand why I put the bunnies in my code. :D
5. Last but not the least, I put in Thor. You should know once you have watched the film.
6. The opening sequence of Marvel films is the intro before everything else
__(DISCLAIMER: Since these objects are in a time warp, I thought of having these PImages look like their figure is being distorted constantly by changing their size every time they are called from the centre)__

* The portal should include:
1. Shapes combined to form the seal of Solomon (just like in the film) rotating vigorously clockwise while it's closed
2. A class of glowing and shrowing(shrinking and growing) particles spinning as it rotates around the portal
3. Number on the corner of the portal every time the user chooses a different place
