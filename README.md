# Assignment1_OOP
This assignment is loosely inspired by the film Doctor Strange. I aim to create a portal where a user can choose a place to teleport to. 
The portal itself should be very interactive and fun with the user on events: 
1. When mouse is clicked and moved, the user is given a chance to create a portal by drawing a portal-like shape
2. The portal should open only right after the correct pattern is drawn 
3. The user has options by pressing keys 1-5 to change the background

It comes along with a user interface relative to the portal, such as: 
1. Time to track the opening of the portal 
2. A knob to change the place 3. Data charts to implement remaining power left (using boolean) 
4. Rewind, slow down, fast forward the environment of the place 
5. Sound effects when portal opens, etc.
